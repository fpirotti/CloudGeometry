The goal of CloudGeometry is to compute geometric features for each point in a point cloud. 

Geometric features catch geometrical patterns around a certain position in 3D space
based on information available from the neighbouring points (local neighborhood).

Geometrical patterns can be described using the eigenvalues of thge 
3D structure tensor  represented by the 3D covariance matrix derived from the 3D coordinates of all points within the local neighborhood 
[Weinmann et al. 2015](#1).

Due to the the expected large volume of points in point clouds that are surveyed with laser scanners or created by photogrammetric inputs, this package uses a fast implementation using [Armadillo C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing](https://arma.sourceforge.net/).

Geometric features are used to describe a point neighbourhood and are widely used to increase the number of features that describe the 3D scene . This can be used as descriptors in training machine learning models for segmentation and classification.

The following geometric features are currently implemented:

-   1st eigenvalue

-   2nd eigenvalue

-   3rd eigenvalue

-   Sum of eigenvalues

-   Omnivariance

-   Eigenentropy

-   Anisotropy

-   Planarity

-   Linearity

-   PCA 1

-   PCA 2

-   Surface variation

-   Sphericity

-   Verticality


## Installation

You can install the development version of CloudGeometry from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fpirotti/CloudGeometry")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to process a lidar point cloud:

``` r

## basic example code

library(CloudGeometry)
gf <- calculateGeometricFeatures(lidar, 3 TRUE)

```
